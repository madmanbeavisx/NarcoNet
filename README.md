# 🧠 NarcoNet  
Server-Client sync Mod for SPT

> "One Connection. Every Mod. Every Setting. More Reliable than your dealer."

## Description
NarcoNet is a synchronization framework for SPT that ensures that every client has the same mod setup as the server, no mismatched configurations, missing dependencies, or version chaos.
When a player connects, NarcoNet will check the servers Mod List and compare it to the client's installation and pushes or removes files auto-magically to keep everything clean and consistent.

## Features
- Automatic mod/config sync between server and client.
- Version and integrity checking.
- Optional dependency enforcement.
- Lightweight, no-nonsense,  p2p protocol.
- Zero tolerance for desyncs.

## Philosophy
> You run your own operation. NarcoNet just keeps your crew supplied.
